## Mentoring and Connected Learning {#mentoring-and-connected-learning}

Where does mentoring fit within Connected Learning? Mentoring within libraries helps foster the following CL principles:

*   **Shared Purpose**_._ Through collaboration with people of all ages, mentoring encourages cross-generational and cross-cultural groups to work towards common goals (Hoffman et al., 2016).
*   **Peer supported**_._ By interacting with other youth through peer mentoring, learners give feedback to each other or simply “hang out” and “mess around” (Ito et al., 2010).
*   **Academically oriented**_._ Mentoring experiences and programs can be designed to support academic success, build career-related skills, or increase community or political engagement.
*   **Interest Driven**_._ Mentors support and guide youth to engage in their passions and interests, encouraging them to “geek out” (Ito et al., 2010).

From the Connected Learning Alliance, check out this video [8:33 min.] from filmmaker Nic Askew. The interview subject is Brother Mike, YouMedia Coordinator and Lead Mentor for the Digital Youth Network. The films asks:

Might we all have the opportunity to mentor another?

How powerful is a single moment of validation to a young imagination?

Might your influence travel further than you might imagine?
