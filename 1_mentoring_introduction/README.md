In supporting today’s young people, librarians around the country are providing a range of mentoring opportunities. Research evidence finds that quality mentoring experiences can make a powerful impact on the personal, professional, and academic lives of young people (Ito et al., 2013; Larson, et al, 2015; Rhodes, 2008). In this module, we offer practical ways and best practices for encouraging mentoring relationships (librarians as mentors, youth mentors, adult and community mentors) within a youth librarian context.
