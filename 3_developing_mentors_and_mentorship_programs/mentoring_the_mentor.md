## Mentoring the mentor {#mentoring-the-mentor}

“Mentoring the mentors” is an integral part of all librarianship. Many librarians we talked to discuss the importance of providing each other with mentoring and support in meetings, training sessions, workshops, or informal conversations (Haines and Campbell, 2016).

Library organizations such as American Libraries Association and YALSA offer mentoring programs such as:

*   YALSA’s virtual mentoring program. Experienced librarians are paired with a new librarian or graduate student in a Library Science program.
*   ALA MentorConnect. Informal mentoring network implemented within ALA Connect that allows all ALA members to join the network and begin serving as a mentor or seeking a mentor.
*   Emerging Leaders Program. Offers mentoring and training for librarians who are new to the field.
*   American Association of School Librarians (AASL)Mentoring. New or interested librarians are paired with a librarian who guides them through challenges associated with working as a school librarians.

Many library associations affiliated with ALA and YALSA also offer mentorship programs such as:

*   REFORMA Mentoring Program. National Association to Provide Libraries and Information Services to Latinos and the Spanish-Speaking, provides a mentorship program to assist those providing services to Latinos.
*   Asian Pacific American Librarians Association. (Research more about their program)
*   Chinese American Librarians Association

In addition, librarians we talked to discuss the informal mentoring that occurs when they network with other librarians. Likewise, social networking, such as creating a professional Facebook page or joining different Facebook groups can allow librarians to connect with others, discuss ideas in a group format, and meet other librarians. INTS-059 says: “I actually call people a lot and I text people and I follow people on their Instagrams. And then I actually like getting together with people in real life and having dinner…” Other librarians have also sought out mentors and connections with those outside the library field, such as teachers, professionals in STEM fields, parents of tweens and teens, and faculty within library schools, who provide unique insight from other areas of expertise.
