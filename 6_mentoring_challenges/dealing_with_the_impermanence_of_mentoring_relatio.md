## Dealing with the impermanence of mentoring relationships {#dealing-with-the-impermanence-of-mentoring-relationships}

A process for the closure of longer term mentoring relationships may be evaluated early on in the planning. Certain youth may be affected by an abrupt closure (DuBois &amp; Karcher, 2013). Here are a few ways to prepare for and close out a mentoring experience:

*   Raise the issue of closure early on to introduce endings as a normal phase of the mentoring process (DuBois &amp; Karcher, 2013).
*   Set clear guidelines for mentors on their expectations after the mentoring program ends
*   When appropriate, offer ways for youth to stay in touch with mentors
*   Create a plan for closure if mentors leave or the relationship needs to end
*   Research suggests providing closure or “ending rituals” or activities to reflect on the end of the relationship can provide youth with growth and learning opportunities (DuBois &amp; Karcher, 2013).
*   Closure plan can include a way for youth and mentors to say goodbye and ask youth reflective questions (e.g., What did you like best about the experience?)
