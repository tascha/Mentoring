## Assisting mentors who havenâ€™t worked with youth or served in a leadership capacity {#assisting-mentors-who-haven-t-worked-with-youth-or-served-in-a-leadership-capacity}

*   At times, a potential mentor may be intimidated or unsure about the &quot;right&quot; approach to working with teens. In these situations, a few approaches may help, such as:
*   Be the facilitator in expert-led programming to help increase the mentor&#039;s level of comfort (Shannon L. interview, 2017)
*   For interns or youth as mentors, allow them to practice and ask questions about how to lead and coach (Kitsap Regional Library, Make. Do. Share., 2017 beta).
*   Provide support in the mentor&#039;s planning activities, workshops, or events. For example, allow the mentor to build the content or curriculum and then offer suggestions for making it work with a teen audience. For example, you could let them know when they should add breaks into the schedule(Shannon L. interview 4-7-17)
