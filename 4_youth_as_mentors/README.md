*   Develop and support youth mentors at your library

Youth mentors can offer mutual benefits to both the library and to teens, including; acquiring leadership skills and learning from the shared interactions with mentees. Within libraries, teens have helped each other prepare for college entrance exams, complete school projects, and experiment with new technologies (Larson, et al., 2013). Some libraries with limited resources may have to accommodate a wide range of ages in their youth programming, making it difficult to provide a deep learning experience for the older or savvier participants. Teen volunteers who serve as mentors can help address this challenge by providing additional support.

After some initial training, youth can serve as volunteer assistants in library programs or as one-on-one technology help for patrons. As an academically-oriented opportunity, youth mentors can complete volunteer credits and develop leadership experience to demonstrate on college applications. For example, at the Kitsap Regional Library, teen interns play a key role and are “treated as leaders, not assistants” (Hoffman, et al., 2016; p. 13; Kitsap Regional Library, 2014). As mentors to other youth, teens receive feedback and learn from their peers (Ito, et. al, 2013). Friendships are forged, and they have the chance to meet people outside of their school or home settings (Emery, 2016).
