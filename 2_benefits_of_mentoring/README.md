Past research findings have shown that mentoring experiences help young people increase their contributions within their community (Meltzer, Muir, Craig 2016). Mentors can promote educational achievement, career development, health, safety, and social and emotional support (Jekielek,et al., 2002; Larson, et al., 2013). These relationships may provide a sense of belonging that young people seek outside their immediate family, friends, and school (Oliver &amp; Cheff, 2012).

Youth who are at-risk may be positively affected by mentoring as research suggests that supportive relationships with caring adults reduce negative outcomes and strengthen protective factors (Keating, et al. 2002). Some research reports show that youth who face an “opportunity gap” but have a mentor in their corner may be more likely to enroll in college than those who did not (MENTOR National Partnership on Mentors, 2017 ). Libraries can provide opportunities for youth to serve as volunteers or peer mentors for other youth. By mentoring their peers, youth gain leadership skills and learn from each others’ unique experiences (Ito, et al., 2013).
